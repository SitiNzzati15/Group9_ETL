As Diana, Princess of Wales, was laid to rest, billions wondered what the princes must be thinking and feeling - and how their lives would play out from that point on.For Harry, this is that story at last.With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.Prince Harry wishes to support British charities with donations from his proceeds from Spare. The Duke of Sussex has donated $1,500,000 to Sentebale, an organisation he founded with Prince Seeiso in their mothers' legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS.

Productivity advice works - and we need it now more than ever - but it's just as important that we also develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don't just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time.

By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don't just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time.

Normally she conceals it well, but on the morning of her betrothal ceremony, Shiori loses control. At first, her mistake seems like a stroke of luck, forestalling the wedding she never wanted. But it also catches the attention of Raikama, her stepmother.A sorceress in her own right, Raikama banishes the young princess, turning her brothers into cranes. She warns Shiori that she must speak of it to no one: for with every word that escapes her lips, one of her brothers will die.Penniless, voiceless, and alone, Shiori searches for her brothers, and uncovers a dark conspiracy to seize the throne. Only Shiori can set the kingdom to rights, but to do so she must place her trust in a paper bird, a mercurial dragon, and the very boy she fought so hard not to marry. And she must embrace the magic she's been taught all her life to forswear--no matter what the cost.\\n</td>\n",

It's time to recalibrate what it means to be happy: there are only so many things we can give a f**k about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter.

As Diana, Princess of Wales, was laid to rest, billions wondered what the princes must be thinking and feeling - and how their lives would play out from that point on.For Harry, this is that story at last.With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.Prince Harry wishes to support British charities with donations from his proceeds from Spare. The Duke of Sussex has donated $1,500,000 to Sentebale, an organisation he founded with Prince Seeiso in their mothers' legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS.

By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don't just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time.

Productivity advice works - and we need it now more than ever - but it's just as important that we also develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don't just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time. We build a deeper, more expansive reservoir of energy to draw from throughout the day, and have greater mental resources at our disposal not only to do good work, but also to live a good life.</td>\n",

The story starts with his retirement, which finally gave him the time and means to pursue matters close to his heart—the plight of the Palestinian people, and the criminalisation of war—before the country’s troubles soon pulled him back into the maelstrom of Malaysian national politics. Unable to sit idly by as his country plummeted towards disaster, Dr Mahathir found himself in the unique position of opposing the very party he led for 22 years. More astonishing was his victory in Malaysia’s 14th General Election and his return at the age of 92 as the seventh Prime Minister of Malaysia, making him the oldest serving head of government in the world at the time.

And it all started from a blog. Perfect for young entrepreneurs, this book shares the secrets of my entrepreneurial journey so far – from starting a business with my boyfriend (telling my dad sure was fun), to writing a business plan on a piece of tissue paper, to fundraising, to dealing with competition and to pretending to nod when my tech team talk about cookies. I share my proud wins for you to get inspired by, and my juicy failures for you to eat popcorn to. Always a work in progress, my story is unfinished. But for now, allow me to present to you, The First Decade. About the author:  Vivy Yusof started blogging about random things and a decade later, has a fashion empire. She co-founded the FashionValet Group in 2010 with her boyfriend and has grown the multi-million dollar...</td>\n",

It's time to recalibrate what it means to be happy: there are only so many things we can give a f**k about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter.    An antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society, and filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humour, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap in the face for a generation spoiled by being rewarded with gold medals just for showing up.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Yang aku selalu tahu, kau adalah untukku. Ziyara yang tidak pernah mencintai lelaki, terjatuh cinta dengan majikannya sendiri. Lelaki yang punya aura, walaupun sudah berusia. Selama ini dia tidak terfikir akan terlibat dalam cinta skandal seperti ini. Namun, dirinya dikhianati lelaki itu. Disebabkan insiden yang tidak pernah Ziyara terfikirkan itu, dia terpaksa tinggal dengan lelaki yang nampak macam bencikan dia sebagai perempuan iaitu Hanz.  “Dengan aku, masih boleh berkompromi. Dengan orang lain, aku tak jamin. Entah-entah sekarang kau sudah diratah orang.” - Hanz.  Mujurlah Hanz bukanlah lelaki yang boleh mengapa-apakan dia. Tapi, kenapa Hanz menyimpannya sedangkan Hanz sendiri tidak sukakan dia? Siap ajak kahwin pula tu. Setelah lama bersama Hanz, Ziyara cuba membawa Hanz kembali ke pangkal jalan. Tidak mahu Hanz terus tersesat. Ziyara sangka Hanz bencikan lelaki, sedangkan bukan begitu. Hanz cuma bencikan Ziyara berbaju kurung. Eh, ada pula lelaki yang alergi baju kurung ya!...</td>\n",

As Diana, Princess of Wales, was laid to rest, billions wondered what the princes must be thinking and feeling - and how their lives would play out from that point on.For Harry, this is that story at last.With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.Prince Harry wishes to support British charities with donations from his proceeds from Spare. The Duke of Sussex has donated $1,500,000 to Sentebale, an organisation he founded with Prince Seeiso in their mothers' legacies, which supports vulnerable children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS.

And it all started from a blog. Perfect for young entrepreneurs, this book shares the secrets of my entrepreneurial journey so far – from starting a business with my boyfriend (telling my dad sure was fun), to writing a business plan on a piece of tissue paper, to fundraising, to dealing with competition and to pretending to nod when my tech team talk about cookies.

Productivity advice works - and we need it now more than ever - but it's just as important that we also develop our capacity for calm. By finding calm and overcoming anxiety, we don't just feel more comfortable in our own skin, we invest in the missing piece that leads our efforts to become sustainable over time. We build a deeper, more expansive reservoir of energy to draw from throughout the day, and have greater mental resources at our disposal not only to do good work, but also to live a good life.    \n",

This standalone work chronicles not just the unexpected journey of Dr Mahathir back to the premiership but also the great changes taking place within Malaysia today. The story starts with his retirement, which finally gave him the time and means to pursue matters close to his heart—the plight of the Palestinian people, and the criminalisation of war—before the country’s troubles soon pulled him back into the maelstrom of Malaysian national politics. Unable to sit idly by as his country plummeted towards disaster, Dr Mahathir found himself in the unique position of opposing the very party he led for 22 years. More astonishing was his victory in Malaysia’s 14th General Election and his return at the age of 92 as the seventh Prime Minister of Malaysia, making him the oldest serving head of government in the world at the time.

This book hopes to detail how I have navigated my life as the daughter of a charismatic politician and a loving father, even as sometimes I have chafed at being constantly under his shadow. It talks about how I have struggled to find my own identity, to defend my worldview at times and to reconcile them with his at others.

Mark Manson, however, doesn't sugar-coat or equivocate: \"F**k positivity,\" he says in his wildly popular internet blog. \"Let's be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\"    Backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, Manson makes the argument that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. It's time to recalibrate what it means to be happy: there are only so many things we can give a f**k about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter.    An antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society, and filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humour, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap in the face for a generation spoiled by being rewarded with gold medals just for showing up.    \n",
